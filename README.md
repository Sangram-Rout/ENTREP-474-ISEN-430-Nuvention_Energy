Entrepreneurship opportunities within energy sector

BIPV (building-integrated photovoltaics) has the potential to revolutionize solar energy, but faces major efficiency, transparency, and durability challenges. BluSolar plans to develop and license a quasi-random nanostructure that, when imprinted on the back electrode of a PV panel, is expected to increase BIPV efficiency by 25-30%. BluSolarâ€™s nanostructure is based on Northwestern IP related to using the nanostructure of Blu-ray discs to improve PV. In addition to BIPV, BluSolar envisions applying their technology to IoT sensors and wearables.
